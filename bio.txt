My name is Emmanuel Sword. I am an emerging professional in the world of software development. I am currently based in Seattle, but I plan to take my skills wherever my path leads me. I have been a Security Site Supervisor in Star Protection Agency for 2 years and have helped train new employees and open new sites in Bellevue. Client relations is a very important aspect of my job. I am currently enrolled in the year up program so that I may further help my current employer develop ways to make our clients feel secure physically and virtually. Just as iron sharpens iron, Mr. Sword strives to make the workplace a better environment while also improving himself.
